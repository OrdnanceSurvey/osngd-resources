# OS NGD QMLs

These are **QML** files for styling OS NGD data in QGIS.

## Quick start guide

**1.** Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/osngd-resources/archive/main.zip) the contents of this repository.

**2.** Load your OS NGD Analytical geopackages into QGIS.

**3.** Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'.

*Repeat step 3 for all layers*
