# Styling Resources

## OS Select+Build and OS NGD API – Features ##

Cartographic styles are available in Outdoor, Road, Light, and Black & White. These can be applied to OS NGD data to give it a cartographic appearance and are available for download [here](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-NGD-Stylesheets).

The following [page](https://labs.os.uk/public/osngd/styling/theme-colors.html) illustrates the "analytical" colours for each theme (then hues of the colour at collection level).

The styling rules in a machine readable (JSON) format can be found in `rules-complete.json`. If preferred, an alternate set (as seen in the documentation images) can be accessed via `rules-standard.json`.

## OS NGD API – Tiles ##

If you are using the OS NGD API – Tiles, all the styling resources including JSON files and sprites are hosted within the Vector Tiles endpoint.
This can be found here: https://api.os.uk/maps/vector/ngd/ota/v1/
