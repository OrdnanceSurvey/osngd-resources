# Oracle DDL

This directory contains all the Data Definition Language (DDL) files for Oracle.

The SQL within them includes all the `CREATE TABLE` statements. There are separate files for each OS NGD feature type.

The DDL is based upon the latest available [data schema version](https://docs.os.uk/osngd/getting-started/os-ngd-core-principles/data-schema-versioning).  Within the `superseded` directory there are previous versions available for reference.

For further information view the [OS NGD Documentation](http://docs.os.uk/osngd).
